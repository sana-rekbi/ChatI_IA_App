# MERN Stack AI Chatbot

This project involves creating an AI chatbot similar to ChatGPT using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and OpenAI's API for natural language processing features.

## Main Objectives

- **AI Chatbot (ChatGPT-style)**: Utilizes OpenAI's API to allow users to ask questions, receive answers, and view code blocks in the interface.
- **User and Conversation Management**: Stores user conversations in a MongoDB database, allowing for retrieval and deletion.
- **Advanced Security**: Implements authentication and authorization mechanisms, including JWT Tokens and HTTP-only cookies, to protect user sessions.
- **Responsive and Modern Design**: Features a fully responsive web interface with a modern design, optimized for various devices and screen sizes.
- **Scalability**: Designed with scalability in mind, allowing for future integrations such as image, audio, or video generation.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Back-end**: Node.js and Express.js for creating the REST API.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user conversations and data.
- **Front-end**: React.js with Material UI for building an interactive web application.
- **Authentication & Security**: BCrypt for password encryption, JWT for authentication, and HTTP-only cookies for securing user sessions.
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI's API (GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 models) for processing chatbot queries.
- **Development & Deployment**: TypeScript for code structuring, and Visual Studio Code as the development environment.
